BI/Reporting platforms are aplenty out there in the market. However one category that is on the rise is embedded BI. Here are some of them I have found thru my research that caught my attention, largely due to the use cases that I have at the moment

[revealbi](https://www.revealbi.io/) by Infragistics

[boldbi](https://www.boldbi.com/) by Syncfusion

[Zoho Analytics](https://www.zoho.com/analytics/)

[Domo Embedded Analytics](https://www.domo.com/embedded-analytics)

With both Domo and Zoho, they offer a more traditional take as to what a bi/analytics platform should be and no doubt Zoho provides a very competitive price point on their offering

Both revealbi and boldbi is interesting, largely because these were not built by traditional bi platform companies, but component suite platforms that sells components to customers, primarily in .NET (judging at how long they have been around, this has to be very lucrative/good business)

Because they were built by companies that builds component suite libraries, their approach is quite different in many ways, and there is much better support on extensibility, which becomes critical in situations where the core platform is just insufficient and you need to use third party libraries to visualize your data, though, many of the features like data masking/column level security is still not available
